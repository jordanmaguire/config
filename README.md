# Config

This is a collection of my dot files and other configuration for my macs.

## Usage

First: A disclaimer. All operations in this script use the force command. That means you config files will be overwritten. I recommend you make a backup first.

`./install.rb` will run the script to setup all the necessary symlinks.

You'll probably need to make that file executable with `chmod +x ./install.rb`
