# Config

This is a collection of my dot files and other configuration for my macs.

## Usage

First: A disclaimer. All operations in this script use the force command. That means your config files will be overwritten. I recommend you make a backup first.

`./install.rb` will run the script to setup all the necessary symlinks.

You'll probably need to make that file executable with `chmod +x ./install.rb`

## Sublime Text 3 Packages

Since I don't know of a way to get a manifest of my packages in source control, I'm going to manually manage them here for now.

This is an incomplete list.

- [Sublime Gherkin Formatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Gherkin%20(Cucumber)%20Formatter): Format example groups
- [Rails OpenView](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Rails%20OpenView): From a controller's action, jump to the ERB file or create a new ERB file for the view
